The Miss Vietnam San Diegoâ„¢ is established with the primary focus of elevating the Vietnamese-American woman as a symbol of beauty and pride captured internally and externally through her poise, grace, intellectual strength, and individuality.

The pageant also serves to promote the Vietnamese culture by retaining the functions of the traditional dress ao dai, developing teamwork through cultural dances, and directing questions to educate the audience on the perception of culture via the eyes of Vietnamese women today. Last but definitely not least, its third purpose is to bring people together, women who participate, family and friends who watch, and all others involved in its formation, fostering a stronger sense of community.

It is an opportunity to develop long-standing friendships and to interact and have fun with peers who carry a similar Vietnamese-American identity. Overall, the Miss Vietnam San Diego is a non-profit event whose only purpose is to serve the Vietnamese community. It serves to elevate the Vietnamese-American woman, to promote our culture and heritage, to develop a lasting bond between people of similar identity, and to define what it means to be united. In accomplishing its goal, it can truly say, everyone is a winner.
